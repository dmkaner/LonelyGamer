Android Social App that enables gamers to create lobbies through any game to play with eachother via chat. 
Implements technologies such as Google Firebase and elastic search. First Android app I made!

If you would like to execute the code on your own machine, clone the enviornment and make sure to open
the folder up in the Android Studio application. There will most likely be some dependency issues due
to different enviorments so make sure to sync up the gradle files when prompted to. The main architecture
of the app is split up file by file for each screen of the app. When ready to run, make sure to use the 
local emulator.
